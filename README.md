# URI Tides Updater

The plugin updates live water temp and tide prediction data from NOAA.  Data is pulled from the station at Quonset Point, RI. This plugin does not include a graphical display; use [URI Tides](https://github.com/uriweb/uri-tides) for that.

## How do I get set up?

1. Install [URI Tides Updater](https://github.com/uriweb/uri-tides-updater/archive/refs/heads/master.zip). For multisite networks, activate it only on one site (e.g. the homepage) to avoid cron job duplication.
2. Install [URI Tides](https://github.com/uriweb/uri-tides/) and activate it where you intend to use it.  Network-activation may be appropriate.
3. Configure the shortcode to taste.
